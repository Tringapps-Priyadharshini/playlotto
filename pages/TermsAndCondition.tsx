                      If any part of the Terms of Service is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Service shall continue in effect.

                    33.1 PlayLottoGlobal reserves the right to decline all, or part, of any bet/wager requested at its sole and absolute discretion. All bets/wagers are placed at your own risk and discretion. 
                    33.2 It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure details of their bets/wagers are correct. Once bets/wagers have been placed they may not be cancelled by the customer. PlayLottoGlobal reserves the right to cancel any bet/wager at any time.
                    33.3 Your funds will be allocated to bets/wagers in the order they are placed and will not be available for any other use. PlayLottoGlobal reserves the right to void and/or reverse any transactions made after a bet/wager has been placed involving allocated funds, either at the time or retrospectively.

                    34.1 PlayLottoGlobal reserves the right to suspend a market at any time. If a market is suspended, any bets accepted inadvertently after such suspension (e.g. a bet placed via our telephone betting service (including all forms of Telebet)) will be made void and the stake refunded. PlayLottoGlobal also reserves the right to cease betting on any markets at any time without notice.
                    34.2 Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same selection(s) having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, PlayLottoGlobal reserves the right to make bets void or withhold payment of returns pending the outcome of any subsequent investigation.
                    34.3 For events where there is no official 'off' declared, the advertised start time of the event will be deemed the 'off'. If for any reason a bet is inadvertently accepted after an event or match has commenced (other than live In-Play betting clearly indicated on the Website), bets will be made void and the stake refunded.
                    34.4 In-Play betting - where we have reason to believe that a bet is placed after the outcome of an event is known, or after the selected participant or team has gained a material advantage (e.g. a score, sending off for the other team etc) we reserve the right to void the bet, win or lose.
                    34.5 If for any reason we are unable to validate the outcome of a particular market (e.g. due to loss of live pictures) and that market is one where the result cannot be verified by a valid source (e.g. ‘time of first goal’ or ‘number of corners’ in a soccer match), we will do everything we can to verify the results using alternative sources. However, where we are unable to verify the result, bets will be made void and stakes refunded, unless settlement of bets is already determined.
